# Example Simplification Results

## What Changed

Both examples were simplified to remove unnecessary simulation complexity:

1. **Removed actual delays** - No more `clock.Sleep()` calls that block execution
2. **Preserved trace storytelling** - All delays are recorded as span tags like `simulated_delay_ms`
3. **Tests run instantly** - Using fake clocks, tests complete in microseconds instead of seconds
4. **Story remains intact** - Traces still show the problems clearly through tags and span structure

## Monday Morning Example

- **Before**: Complex sleep patterns simulating real latency with jitter
- **After**: Tags show what the delay would have been, no actual blocking
- **Result**: Tests run in 0.014s instead of simulated 5+ seconds

Key changes:
- Services record `simulated_delay_ms` tags instead of sleeping
- Connection pool contention visible through tags without actual blocking
- Cascade pattern clear from span hierarchy

## Phantom Latency Example  

- **Before**: SDK retries with exponential backoff actually sleeping
- **After**: Backoff times recorded in tags, no blocking
- **Result**: Tests complete instantly while showing 3.1s of "hidden" backoff time

Key changes:
- SDK records `backoff_ms` tags without sleeping
- Network latency skipped but documented
- Retry cascade visible through attempt spans

## Why This Works

The examples are **teaching tools**, not production simulators:

1. **Traces tell the story** - Tags and span structure show the problems
2. **Fast feedback** - Tests run instantly for better developer experience  
3. **Clear patterns** - Problems are obvious in trace output without waiting
4. **Deterministic** - Fake clocks ensure reproducible results

## The Lesson

We don't need realistic delays to demonstrate tracez value. The trace output itself tells the compelling story of hidden problems that traditional metrics miss.
